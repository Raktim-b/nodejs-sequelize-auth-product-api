# 📌 Project Overview

This project is a backend REST API developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MySQL** with **Sequelize ORM**.

The application allows users to securely register, log in, and manage products while implementing **JWT Authentication**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **Sequelize Associations**, **Pagination**, **Search**, and **Image Upload**.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building scalable backend applications using a relational database.

---

# 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand how modern backend applications are built using **MySQL** and **Sequelize ORM**.

The application allows:

- Secure User Authentication
- Product Management
- JWT Protected APIs
- Role-Based Authorization
- Search & Pagination
- Sequelize Relationships

---

# 🚀 Business Scenario

Imagine an online store where administrators manage products while customers can browse available products.

The system ensures that:

- Only authenticated users can access protected APIs.
- Only administrators can create, update, or delete products.
- Customers can browse product listings securely.
- Products can be searched and paginated efficiently.

---

# ✨ Features

## 🔐 Authentication Module

- User Registration
- User Login
- JWT Authentication
- Password Hashing (bcryptjs)
- Protected Routes

---

## 👤 User Module

Users can

- Register
- Login
- View Profile

---

## 📦 Product Module

Administrators can

- Create Product
- Update Product
- Delete Product
- Upload Product Image
- Update Product Stock
- Activate / Deactivate Product

Users can

- View Product List
- View Product Details

---

## 🔎 Search & Pagination

Supports

- Product Search
- Product Pagination
- Product Sorting

Examples

```
GET /api/products?keyword=laptop

GET /api/products?page=1&limit=10

GET /api/products?sort=price
```

---

## 🗑 Soft Delete

Products are soft deleted using Sequelize's `paranoid` feature.

Deleted records can be recovered without permanently removing them from the database.
